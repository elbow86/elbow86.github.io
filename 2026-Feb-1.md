title: Skills vs Instructions - AI Agent Configuration
---

## Summary

Understanding the difference between **skills** and **instructions** is key to effectively configuring AI agents like GitHub Copilot.

**Custom Instructions**
Use them for information that is relevant every single time you use the agent.
Good for general coding guidelines that apply broadly to almost every activity.

**Skills**
Ideal for specialized tasks, routines, advice, or workflows that are useful some of the time, but not all of the time.
Excellent for avoiding "polluting" the context window with irrelevant information

## 📋 Instructions

**Instructions** are context-specific rules and guidelines that apply to particular files, folders, or patterns in your codebase.

### Characteristics:
- **Scoped**: Apply to specific file patterns or directories
- **Project-specific**: Tailored to your codebase conventions
- **Procedural**: Define "how" things should be done in this project
- **Override defaults**: Custom rules that supersede general behavior

### Example Use Cases:
```markdown
---
applyTo: '**/*.ts'
---
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Follow the project's naming conventions in /docs/style-guide.md
```

### Common Applications:
- Code style and formatting rules
- Architecture patterns specific to your project
- File organization guidelines
- Framework-specific conventions
- Testing strategies for this codebase

---

## 🎯 Skills

**Skills** are domain-specific knowledge packages that provide general expertise on broader topics.

### Characteristics:
- **Domain-focused**: Cover entire knowledge areas
- **Reusable**: Apply across multiple projects
- **Educational**: Teach concepts and best practices
- **Context-independent**: Not tied to specific file structures

### Example Use Cases:
```markdown
Skill: frontend-design
- Principles for avoiding generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Modern web design best practices
- Accessibility guidelines
- UX patterns and anti-patterns
```

### Common Applications:
- Design principles (UI/UX, architecture patterns)
- Language-specific best practices (Python, TypeScript, Rust)
- Framework expertise (React, Vue, Django)
- Domain knowledge (machine learning, cryptography, databases)
- Development methodologies (TDD, DDD, clean architecture)

## 🔄 Key Differences

| Aspect | Instructions | Skills |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Scope** | Project/file-specific | Domain-wide |
| **Purpose** | "Do it this way here" | "Know this topic" |
| **Reusability** | Low (project-bound) | High (cross-project) |
| **Content** | Rules & conventions | Knowledge & principles |
| **When Applied** | Matching file patterns | Relevant task detection |

## 🎨 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Building a React Dashboard

**Instruction** (`.github/instructions/components.md`):
```markdown
---
applyTo: 'src/components/**/*.tsx'
---
- All components must be in separate folders with index.tsx
- Include tests in __tests__ subfolder
- Use barrel exports in index.ts
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms/molecules/organisms)
```

**Skill** (`skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`):
```markdown
Frontend Design Principles:
- Avoid centered purple gradients and glass-morphism
- Use intentional white space instead of drop shadows
- Design for content hierarchy and scanning patterns
- Implement accessible color contrasts (WCAG AA minimum)
```

The **instruction** tells you how to organize your specific project's component files. The **skill** teaches you how to design good-looking, accessible interfaces regardless of the project.

## 💡 Best Practices

### When to Use Instructions:
✅ Project has unique conventions  
✅ Need to enforce team standards  
✅ Working with specific frameworks in specific ways  
✅ File organization or naming patterns  

### When to Use Skills:
✅ Teaching domain expertise  
✅ Providing best practices for a technology  
✅ Sharing reusable knowledge across projects  
✅ General principles that apply broadly

## 🔧 Configuration in Practice

In a typical setup with GitHub Copilot:

```
.github/
  ├── instructions/          # Project-specific rules
  │   ├── api.instructions.md
  │   ├── testing.instructions.md
  │   └── todos.instructions.md
  └── skills/                # General domain knowledge
      ├── frontend-design/
      │   └── SKILL.md
      ├── python-async/
      │   └── SKILL.md
      └── security/
          └── SKILL.md
```

The agent automatically:
1. Applies **instructions** when working with matching files
2. Loads **skills** when tasks match the skill domain
3. Combines both for comprehensive context

---

## 🚀 Takeaway

Think of **instructions** as your project's rulebook and **skills** as your team's library of expertise. Instructions keep your codebase consistent; skills keep your solutions excellent.

Use instructions for the "what" and "how" of your specific project. Use skills for the "why" and deeper understanding of technical domains.
