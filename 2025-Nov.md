# Getting Copilot to have a look at my WSL Terminal
## Nov 2025
Looking at your .bash_history, you've been quite busy with several interesting projects! Here's what stands out:

### Key Activities
1. Docker & Container Management
You've been running several containerized services:

Ollama & Open-WebUI: AI model hosting with GPU support (--gpus=all)
Rancher: Kubernetes management platform
Homepage: Dashboard application
Minecraft Servers: Multiple Paper servers with specific configurations

2. Kubernetes/Rancher Experimentation
Set up Rancher for container orchestration
Attempted to join nodes to a cluster using system-agent-install scripts
Eventually cleaned up RKE2/Rancher components (likely troubleshooting issues)

3. Minecraft Server Hosting 🎮
Multiple Docker-based Minecraft servers with:

Different ports (25565, 25566, 25567)
Resource limits (2 CPUs, 4GB RAM)
Paper server on experimental channel
JVM optimization flags (-XX:+UseG1GC)
Custom seeds for world generation

4. Checkers Game Development ♟️
This is particularly cool:

Built a 3D checkers game with Python backend and JavaScript frontend
Used Three.js for 3D rendering with OrbitControls
Created a custom OrbitControls implementation when the library had issues
Set up a GitHub repo and wrestled with SSH keys for pushing code

5. Linux System Administration
Network diagnostics (ping, netstat, SSH configuration)
Process management (ps, htop, pkill)
Python virtual environment setup struggles (eventually resolved)
Git configuration tweaks


### Most Interesting Part

Your 3D checkers game development shows real problem-solving - you wrote a complete custom OrbitControls.js implementation (that massive heredoc around line 265+) when the standard Three.js library wasn't cooperating. That's serious JavaScript/3D graphics work!

The Minecraft servers show you're hosting a gaming infrastructure, and the Ollama setup suggests you're experimenting with local AI models. Pretty diverse tech stack!
