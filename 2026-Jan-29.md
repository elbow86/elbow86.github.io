Video goes on to cover using the Copilot SDK to leverage the Copilot CLI to make apps

## MCP Apps

Lots of pain and fun.
Because Windows... had to change some things.
Some annoyances:  Husky slows down commits, so disabled it for now.

But cool to have UI for MCP apps.  (MCP Apps with UI)

Created 
- Game of Life
- Family Budget Tool
- Color Picker Tool

## Dev Containers

Cool stuff.. re-familiarizing myself with them.

## Obsidian
Using Obsidian for notes, and loving it!
